Understanding Data Science overall concepts 

## Statistics 
    statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing the data for better decision making.
    
    **Data** - Fact or information that can be measured. example - EmployeeID, Age, Gender and Salary.

Statistics divided into two categories 
## Descriptive Statistics
    Data can be summarized using mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation and display the data in the form of charts and graphs like histograms, bar charts, pie charts and scatter plots. 

    Example - calculating the average age of employees in company XYZ 

## Inferential Statistics 
    Understand or Interpret the meaning of descriptive statistics. Describe the meaning of collected data like investigating the relationship between variables or fields, draw conclusions or inferences or do some predictions.

    Example - Now understand the relationship between age of employees and Gender, or between Age and Salary to draw some conclusions or predictions


### Key words in statistics and data science
    
    **Populations (N) **     - Total employees in company XYZ - denoted by N
    **Sample (n) **          - Taking a sample of employees in company XYZ, this sample is extracted using different sampling       techniques, denoted by n

#### Sampling Techniques
    1. Simple Random Sampling - Pick employees in random from company XYZ for your sample(n), no logics or rules to choose an employee, its just random.
    
    2. Stratified Sampling   - Here the population is split into groups where each group is **non-overlapping**. Strata means layering. 
    
        Example1: Pick all male employees into one sample and female employees into sample to conduct some survey.
        Exmpple2: Pick all employees with less than 5 years experience into one sample, 5-10 into another sample,  rest all into another sample.
        Example3: Pick all employees with python Experience into one sample, .Net experience into another sample, Networking into another sample.
    
    3. Systematic Sampling - Pick every nth indivdual from population for survey.
    
        Example1: pick every 5th employee to do survey.

    4. Convenience Sampling - Choose the people who has expertise in that domain or subject or topic who can take that survey.
        Example1: conduct survey on data science statistics - so take a sample population who is working on data or statistics
